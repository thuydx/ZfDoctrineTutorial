ZF2 Module: Doctrine Bugs Example
=================================
By Evan Coury

Information
-----------
This repository is my efforts to port the Doctrine 2.1 ORM tutorial to a ZF2
Module. The tutorial this is based on is available 
[here](http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.1/en/tutorials/getting-started-xml-edition.html)
and the original files for the tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2-orm-tutorial) on GitHub.
